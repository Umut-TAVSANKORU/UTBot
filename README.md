# WHY UTBOT?
* Testing before adding the code
* Coding all my time that hasn't got business
* Uses variables,so dynamic
* Args usage
* Good command names
* Fun Commands
* Moderation Commands
* Creative commands
* Music command that only get the video token after watch?v=, disables long messages
* App info command that get your package.json variables so you do not need to write them two times
# WHAT DO I NEED TO DO BEFORE USING THIS CODE?
:one:Create your own config.json file that has required variables.
:two:Rename the command variables like the channel ID's or the message that sent, or these things.
:three:Do not copy my license or readme, delete them or use yours.
:four:Add the credits,you do not need them in the all messages, just use them in hard coded commands.
